A quizzing app where you can make and edit decks of cards for your quizzing pleasure!

## Getting Started

With a sample deck included, make your own by using the create deck option! It allows you to store the name and a quick description of the content inside.

If you need to change some of the info, use the deck editor! Feel free to change the deck's name, description, and any cards inside. Just be sure to save the deck before you leave.

When quizzing, select the deck and enter the game! You can opt to have the questions or answers first. Tapping the card will reveal the other side, next will cycle through them, and quit will bring you back to the deck selection!

Thank you for using our app.
